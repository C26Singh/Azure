What is Azure?
Azure is a cloud computing platform and service.
Services it provides  for computing, analytics, storage, and networking.
services can be used to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications.


Key Concepts:
Regions and Availability Zones:
Each region is a set of data centers deployed within a specific geographic area. Availability Zones are physically separate locations within a region to ensure high availability.


Region: East US
  ├── Availability Zone 1 (Data Center 1)
  ├── Availability Zone 2 (Data Center 2)
  └── Availability Zone 3 (Data Center 3)

Region: West Europe
  ├── Availability Zone 1 (Data Center 1)
  ├── Availability Zone 2 (Data Center 2)
  └── Availability Zone 3 (Data Center 3)

Resource Groups: Logical containers for managing and grouping related resources in Azure.

Practical Use Cases
Multi-Region Deployment:low latency and provide regional redundancy.

Zone-Redundant Storage:nsure data availability even if one zone fails.
 use a load balancer to distribute traffic, ensuring that the application remains available even if one zone goes down.

Azure Virtual Machines (VMs): VMs are scalable computing resources
Use Case: Running custom applications, hosting websites, or setting up development and test environments.

Steps to Create a VM:
Navigate to Azure Portal.
Create a Resource: Select "Virtual Machine" from the Compute category.
Configure VM: Choose an image (e.g., Windows Server or Ubuntu), size, and configure settings.
Networking and Storage: Set up networking options and attach storage.
Review and Create: Review the configuration and create the VM.
